# BC4D4J Common
This module provides utility functionality on top of *bc4d4j-core*. The utilities range from easily building commands
to providing opinionated implementations to the command functionality bindings. Ignoring a few notable exceptions, this
module is intended to be used fully by both Kotlin and Java; allowing easy interop and usage between the two languages.
